You should setup GlusterFS for moodledata, Unison is not fast enough. You also need to make sure, important, that you configure each Moodle Cache ( MUC ) into memcache/d.

You can also go the NFS route for moodledata, but the same goes for the MUC as above. If you disregard the MUC settings then your site will be slow.

If you are using multimaster in a active/active scenario I would move away from it, use Galera http://galeracluster.com/ . Version 3 of Galera added some really nice features and supports MySQL 5.6 GTID's, this is especially good for a situation like ours, using WAN replication.

On a side note, we use GlusterFS+Galera+Memcache/d for cross datacenter DR/Failover. No issues or complaints from our end-users so far.
