1) Set the source server in "Maintenance Mode" to avoid writting/modifying to the database
	<Username> are unaffected by the "Maintenance Mode". Avoid them modifiying the DB
2) Backup the Moodle Database from the source server
3) Restore the Moodle Database to the target server
4) Copy the MoodleData directory from the source to the target server
	see "$CFG->dataroot" in /var/www/html/config.php
5) Copy the Moodle code from the old server to the new server
	/var/www/moodle
6) Update config.php with the URL of the new serve
	replace the value of "$CFG->wwwroot" in /var/www/html/config.php
	add: $CFG->reverseproxy = true;
		//* if server is reverse proxied by nginx
7) Update links containing wwwroot in the database
	{wwwroot}/<Username>/tool/replace/index.php				(i.e. <Site>/<Username>/tool/replace/index.php)
		Search whole database for:	oldwwwwroot		(i.e. <Site>.<Domain>)
		Replace with this string: 	newwwwroot		(i.e. <Site>.<Domain>)
8) changes hosts on the new server
	$ nano /etc/hosts
	$ hostname newwwwroot
9) ReCAPTURE
If you migrate to a new domain and have setup Email-based_self-registration, you need to create new <Site>-Keys at google. You will find the explanation and links to google in Email-based_self-registration.

10) nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
	replace ServerName oldserver
11) check if any SOAP key are installed to other sites.
	ie. Edwiser Bridge sets a key on moodle, this key is for a specific wordpres site. If incorrectly installed, moodle will redirect to the incorrect wordpress site after logon
