-use eAccelerator to speed up PHP execution
-properly configured and optimized server with a high concurrency level
-NGIX can handle much more websites than APACHE without lag
-Get a 1GB+ port and 100 TB+ or unmetered.
-recommended to use 2 dedicated servers for uptime, even better is cloud redundancy.
-Check the settings on your network card. You may get an improvement in performance by increasing the use of buffers and transmit/receive descriptors (balance this with processor and memory overheads) and off-loading TCP checksum calculation onto the card instead of the OS.
