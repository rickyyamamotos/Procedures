Tool for converting tables
A command line tool is included in Moodle for converting tables to Barracuda.

To view tables requiring conversion, use the list option:

$ php <Username>/cli/mysql_compressed_rows.php --list
Here is an example output:

mdl_data                            Compact     (needs fixing) 
mdl_data_fields                     Compact     (needs fixing)
mdl_enrol_paypal                    Compact     (needs fixing)
To proceed with the conversion, run the command using the fix option:

$ php <Username>/cli/mysql_compressed_rows.php --fix
Successful table conversion will be reported in the output, for example:

mdl_data                   ... Compressed
mdl_data_fields            ... Compressed
mdl_enrol_paypal           ... Compressed
Please note that the commands must be executed on your moodle directory. Once tables are fixed, the warning message will no longer be displayed.

For further information on InnoDB file formats see the MySQL InnoDB glossary - Antelope and the MySQL InnoDB glossary - Barracuda.

If you get errors due to having insufficient privileges to run these commands (this is quite likely) then the easiest solution is to generate the required SQL commands using,

$ php <Username>/cli/mysql_compressed_rows.php --showsql
