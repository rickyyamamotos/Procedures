Configure your browser to use the proxy listener
	Options -> Network Options -> Proxy
		127.0.0.1:8080

In Burp, go to the "Proxy" tab, and then the "Intercept" sub-tab.
These tabs should be highlighted, and there should be an HTTP request showing in the main panel.

Intercept does hold the HTTP request and responses from the browser, so it can be modified before being sent/received.
