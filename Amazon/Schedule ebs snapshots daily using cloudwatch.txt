better use "Schedule ebs snapshots daily using LifeCycle Manage.txt"

log into the aws console -> EC2 -> EBS -> Volumes -> get "Volume ID" of the volume we want to backup
	vol-<ID> 
log into the aws console -> Cloudwatch -> Events -> Rules -> Create Rule
   -> Select "Schedule" -> in the "Fixed rate of" box, type 1 -> and select "days"
   -> Click on "Add Targets" -> Select "EC2 CreateSnapshot <Site> call" from the drop-down menu
   -> In the "Volume ID*" box, type the "Volume ID" obtained from the previous step (i.e. vol-<ID>)
   -> Choose "Create a new role for this specific resource" -> Choose "Configure details"
   -> give the rule a name -> Check "enabled" -> Click on "Create rule"

To restore, create a new EC2 with free Ubuntu 20 ami, then attach a new volume created from the desired snapshot
