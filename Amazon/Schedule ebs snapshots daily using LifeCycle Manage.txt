Configuring automatic Backups for <Site>
General Settings
1) a snapshot of the EBS volume used by <Site> will be backed up daily
2) only the last 10 snapshots will be kept. (this setting can be modified as required)
Procedure to Set a Backup Schedule
log into the aws console -> EC2 -> EBS -> Volumes -> get "Volume ID" of the volume we want to backup
	(i.e. vol-<ID>)
log into the aws console -> EC2 -> EBS -> Volumes -> select the volume (i.e. vol-<ID>) 
   -> Select the "Tags" tab -> ensure a tag exists for the volume, otherwise create a tag
   (i.e. ["name"," storage of <Site>"])
log into the aws console -> EC2 -> EBS -> "LifeCycle Manage" -> Click "Create Lifecycle Policy"
   -> on "Policy type", select "EBS snapshot policy" -> on "Select resource type", select "Volume"
   -> in the "Description*" box, type: snapshot of the ebs of <Site>
   -> in the "Target with these tags" drop-down menu, select the tag and its value (i.e. ["name"," storage of <Site>"])
      to identify what to backup
   -> in the "IAM role", select "Default role"
   -> in the "Schedule name" box, type: Schedule to backup the ebs of <Site> com
   -> in "Frequency", select: daily
   -> in "Every", select 24					//* once a day
   -> in "Starting at", type 08:00 UTC				//* 8 am UTC == 3 am EST
   -> in "Retention type*", select 10				//* keep only 10 days of backups
   -> in "Policy status after creation", select "Enable policy"
   -> click on "Create Policy"



EBS volume Restoration Procedure
First, create a new volume from the desired snapshot (backed up snapshot)
Second, detach the existing volume from the <Site> EC2
Third, attach the new volume to the <Site> EC2 instance as /dev/sda1
Fourth, launch the instance
Fifth, delete the old EBS volume.
Finally, reconfigure the "LifeCycle Manage" rule to backup the new EBS volume.
   by setting a tag to the new EBS volume, and updating the tag on the "LifeCycle Manage" rule


Total Restoration Procedure
First, create a new EC2 with free Ubuntu 20 ami (AMI ID:ami-0a91cd140a1fc148a, AMI Name:ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-20201026)
Second, create a new volume from the desired snapshot (backed up snapshot)
Third, detach the existing volume from the new EC2
Fourth, attach the new volume to the new EC2 instance as /dev/sda1
Fifth, launch the instance, fix the public DNS A Record to point to the new IP addresss of the new Instance
Sixth, delete the old EBS volume.
Finally, reconfigure the "LifeCycle Manage" rule to backup the new EBS volume
   by setting a tag to the new EBS volume, and updating the tag on the "LifeCycle Manage" rule
