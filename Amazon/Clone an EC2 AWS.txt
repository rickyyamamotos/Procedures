	1) create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) based on the original EC2 instance from the source account.
	2) Share the AMI with the target account
	3) Launch a new instance based on that AMI from the target account.

Create a snapshot of the EC2 volume
	Ensure the following settings on the source EC2 instance
		networking is DHCP
	Create snapshot on the source aws account
		AWS console of source account -> EC2 instance -> Snapshots from the left pane -> create snapshot -> volume
			volume to copy:	vol-<ID>	/dev/sda1	30
	If the target account is in a different region than th source aws account, then copy the snapshot to the target region
		AWS console of source account -> top menu -> see region (I.E. Ohio)
		AWS console of target account -> top menu -> see region (I.E. N. Virginia)
		AWS console of source account -> EC2 instance -> Snapshots from the left pane -> Select snapshot -> Actions -> Copy -> Destination Region
			the target AWS account's region (I.E. N. Virginia)
			description: [Copied snap-<ID> from us-east-2] test-volume-snapshot-12082020
	Give access to the target account over the snapshot	
		AWS console of source account -> EC2 instance -> Snapshots from the left pane -> Select snapshot -> Actions -> Change Permissions -> Private -> Account: 
			<Account>		<Site> AWS (<Site>@<Site>)
			Note- if different regions, change permission to the copied snapshot
	Create a volume on the target account
		AWS console of target account -> top menu -> drop-down menu -> select the source's region (I.E. Ohio)
		AWS console of target account -> EC2 instance -> Snapshots from the left pane -> Drop-down menu -> Private snapshots
		//* snap-<ID> 30 GiB <Site>1-12082020  
			-> Select Snaposhot -> Create Volume -> select size, region, etc
	See if volume was created
		AWS console of target account -> top menu -> drop-down menu -> select the target's region (I.E. N. Ohio)
		AWS console of target account -> EC2 instance -> volumes
			vol-<ID> 30 GiB gp2 100 
	Create a new EC2 instance with the required resources and only 8 Gb of storage
	Mount the target volume to the new instance
		Stop the instance.
		Detach the currebt root EBS volume (8 Gb) mounted on the instance
			AWS console of target account -> EC2 instance -> volumes -> select the 8 Gb volume -> Actions -> Detach
		Attach the alternate (target) EBS volume (30 Gb) as the root: /dev/sda1
			AWS console of target account -> EC2 instance -> volumes -> select the 30 Gb volume -> Actions -> Attach -> select the new EC2
			instance -> /dev/sda1
		Start the instance.
	Create a Public DNS record to point to the new EC2 instance IP address
		new EC2 instance IP address:	XXX.XXX.XXX.184
		godaddy CN records
			<Site>	<ID>.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
			www.<Site>	<ID>.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
	Allow HTTP/HTTPS to the site
		modify the EC2 instance security group to add inbound HTTP and HTTPS
	Change the root address of wordpress
		ssh to the instance -> nano /var/www/html/wp-content/themes/*/function/php
			update_option( 'siteurl', 'https://<Site>' );
			update_option( 'home', 'https://<Site>' );
		change ServerName <Site> on
			/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default-le-ssl.conf
			/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
			/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/phpmyadmin.conf
		change /etc/hostname
			<Site>
		change /etc/hosts
			127.0.0.1 localhost <Site>
		service apache2 restart
