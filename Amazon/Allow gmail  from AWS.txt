Just use an SSH dynamic proxy to schlep your local browser session through your server.
Run this locally:
	$ ssh ubuntu@<Site>.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com -D8888
Or using putty and a private key from windows
	C:\> plink.exe ubuntu@<Site>.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com -i "C:\Users\rick.yamamoto\Desktop\IT Change Log\Websites\<Site>.<Domain>\XX-10192020-new.ppk" -D 8888
Then go into your browser's configuration and set it to use a socks proxy at 127.0.0.1:8888.
	In Internet Explorer -> Optins -> Connections -> Lan Settings -> Check "Use a proxy server for your LAN" -> Advanced -> All blanks except Socks 127.0.0.1 8888
Verify
	Open Internet Explorer and google for "My IP address"
Allow GMAIL
	Open Internet explorer, go to https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha
	Username: <Email>
	Password: <Password>
