1) Get hostname's addresses from nagios
	see address.txt
2) Get the IP addreses of the hostname's addresses
	see ip-address.txt
3) Create a list of fqdn which IPs are XXX.XXX.XXX.248,  XXX.XXX.XXX.229,  XXX.XXX.XXX.229
    XXX.XXX.XXX.248,  XXX.XXX.XXX.229,  XXX.XXX.XXX.229 are reverse proxies
    for XXX.XXX.XXX.229, we need to manually change the proxy ip to the real ip
    for XXX.XXX.XXX.248,  XXX.XXX.XXX.229, we need to find out what are the ssh ports
	create proxied-fqdn.txt and load it into nagios:/tmp/
3) Get list of SSH ports of the ip-addresses
	see port-address.txt

4) connect to each host via ssh, run "curl https://s3-ats-migration-test.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/test.jpg"
   and get the result in a table
	see ca-address.txt
