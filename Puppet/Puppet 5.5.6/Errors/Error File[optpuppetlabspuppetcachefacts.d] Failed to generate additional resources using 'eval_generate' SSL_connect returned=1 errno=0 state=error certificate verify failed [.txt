Error File[optpuppetlabspuppetcachefacts.d] Failed to generate additional resources using 'eval_generate' SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error certificate verify failed 
     [unable to get local issuer certificate for /CN=<Site>-puppet-office]


THE ERROR IS CAUSED BY A PUPPET VERSION CONFLICT BETWEEN AGENT AND MASTER
Verify puppet agent version
	On the master:
		puppet cert clean test2.<Domain>
			//* replace test2.<Domain> with the hostname of the agent server
		/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet --version
			//* it should be 5.5.6 as on the puppet master
	On the agent:
		/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet --version
			//* it should be 5.5.6 as on the puppet master
remove current version of puppet-agent
	apt-get purge puppet-agent
	rm /etc/puppetlabs -rf
	apt-cache showpkg puppet-agent
		//* if the repository is already installed
		//* The output should give something like 
		//* 	5.5.7-1xenial (/var/lib/apt/lists/apt.puppetlabs.com_dists_xenial_puppet5_binary-amd64_Packages)
		//* 	5.5.6-1xenial (/var/lib/apt/lists/apt.puppetlabs.com_dists_xenial_puppet5_binary-amd64_Packages)
		//* 	5.5.4-1xenial (/var/lib/apt/lists/apt.puppetlabs.com_dists_xenial_puppet5_binary-amd64_Packages)
	apt-get install puppet-agent=5.5.6-1xenial
reconfigure puppet-agent



The following did not work
===========================
On the master:
	puppet cert clean test2.<Domain>
On the agent:
	1a. On most platforms: find /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl -name test2.<Domain>.pem -delete
	1b. On Windows: del "\etc\puppetlabs\puppet\ssl\certs\test2.<Domain>.pem" /f
	2. puppet agent -t
