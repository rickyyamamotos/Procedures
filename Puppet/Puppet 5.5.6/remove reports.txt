In the puppetserver, reports pill up with time. They need to be removed to avoid filling the server's storage

Manuallly:
=========
$ find /opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetserver/reports/ -mmin +300 -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -r rm > /dev/null 2>&1

Automatically using puppets:
===========================
$ nano /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
	node puppet_server {
	    tidy { '/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetserver/reports':
	            age     => '30d',
	            matches => "*.yaml",
	            recurse => true,
	            rmdirs  => false,
	            type    => ctime,
	    }
$ /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet parser validate /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/user/manifests/init.pp
$ /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet parser validate /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
