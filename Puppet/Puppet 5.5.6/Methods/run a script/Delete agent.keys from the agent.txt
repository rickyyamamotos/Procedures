If you reinstalled the wazuh/ossec/securityonion, then puppet will not join the puppet client with the wazuhaster
Because the wazuhaster lost their key,
We need to delete the keys from the wazuhgent

On the puppet master
we need to disable wazuhgent.pp
	$ cd  /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/
	$ mv wazuhgent.pp wazuhgent.pp.bak
	$ cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/
	$ mkdir deletewazuhclientkey
	$ cd deletewazuhclientkey
	$ mkdir files
	$ mkdir manifests
	$ mkdir templates
	$ mkdir tests
	$ cd files
	$ nano deletewazuhclientkey.sh
		#!/bin/bash
		#SCRIPT NAME: deletewazuhclientkey.sh
		#PURPOSE: Delete the wazuhssec client.key from wazuhlients
		#         to force them to renjoin the wazuhsses/securityonion master
		#         This is needed if we replace the securityonion master and all client 
		#         keys were lost

		vfile="/var/ossec/etc/client.keys"
		if [ -f $vfile ] ; then
		   mv /var/ossec/etc/client.keys /var/ossec/etc/client.keys.bak
		fi
	$ cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/deletewazuhclientkey/manifests/
	$ nano init.pp
		class deletewazuhclientkey {
		    file { "/tmp/deletewazuhclientkey.sh":
			ensure => "present",
		        mode => "0711",
		        owner => 'root',
		        group => 'root',
		        source => 'puppet:///modules/deletewazuhclientkey/deletewazuhclientkey.sh',
		        checksum => mtime,
		    }
		    exec { "Deleting the client.key":
		        command => "/tmp/XXXXX.sh",
		        cwd => "/tmp",
		        user => "root",
		    }
		}
	$ nano /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
		node default {
		   include deletewazuhclientkey
		}
	$ service puppetserver restart

Give it 2 or 3 hours for all the keys to be deleted
	$ nano /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
		node default {
			remove this line =====>   include deletewazuhclientkey
	$ cd  /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/
	$ mv wazuhgent.pp.bak wazuhgent.pp
	$ service puppetserver restart

Give it 2 or 3 hours and check the securityonion for new wazuhlients
