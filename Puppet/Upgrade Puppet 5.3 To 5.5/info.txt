Upgrading the puppetserver package effectively upgrades Puppet Server. 
your node’s package manager automatically upgrades puppet-agent if the new version of puppetserver requires it.

Locked puppet yum 
	For yum packages locked with the versionlock plugin, 
		nano /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/versionlock.list 
			//* delete 0:puppetserver-5.3.5-1.el7
	or 
		$ yum versionlock delete puppetserver

=====>>>> GIVE SOME TIME (2 HOURS) FOR ALL AGENTS TO UPDATE <<<======
On the puppet master
$ yum versionlock delete 0:puppetserver-5.3.5-1.el7.*
$ yum update puppetserver
	//* this will update puppet 5.3.5 to 5.3.9
$ puppetserver --version
The puppetserver package depends on the puppet-agent package, and your node’s package manager automatically upgrades puppet-agent if the new version of puppetserver requires it.
On the puppet nodes
$ /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet --version
$ /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --test

For Puppet agent in windows. You need to manually install the new puppet-agent version.
	You don't need to uninstall the agent before reinstalling unless you’re upgrading from 32-bit Puppet to the 64-bit version

Upgrading to Puppet 6
$ cat /etc/*-release
	CentOS 7
$ cd /tmp
$ wget https://yum.puppet.com/puppet6-release-el-7.noarch.rpm
$ rpm -i /tmp/puppet6-release-el-7.noarch.rpm
