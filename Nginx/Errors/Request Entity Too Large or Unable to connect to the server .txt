after uploading a file into the server via http
	i.e uloading a scorm file into moodle
	you get an error "unable to connect to the server"
	and chrome console shows "Request Entity Too Large"
It is fixed by modifying the active php.ini file
	 max_input_time = 6000
	 max_execution_time = 6000
	 upload_max_filesize = 4096M
	 post_max_size = 4096M
	 memory_limit = 4096M
If the server is using nginx as reverse proxy, we need to set nginx to allow bing file
	on the nginx server
		$ nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
			add the following line inside the http {} paragraph
				client_max_body_size 4096M
