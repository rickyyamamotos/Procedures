After cloning a WP site, the new clone will point/forward to the original site.
To avoid this temporary, so site.com/<Username> can be modified, 
do the following:
-identify the active theme. See the original wp site, and determine the original theme
-ssh log onto the new clone
-$ cd /var/www/html/wp-content/themes
-$ cd /"active theme"
	replace "active theme" with the name of the actual active theme
-nano function.php
-add the following line just after the <?php
	update_option( 'siteurl', 'http://<Site>' );
	update_option( 'home', 'http://<Site>' );
		where http://<Site> is the url of the newly cloned wp site
-$ log onto the wordpress site
		http://<Site>/wp-admim
		where http://<Site> is the url of the newly cloned wp site
site/phpmyadmin -> WP_database -> wp_options
	siteurl: 
	home: 
$ change the setting of the site
-remove the 2 lines added to function.php

also modified the VHOST
nano /etc/apache2/sites-enable/servername.
	modify the ServerName, redirect, etc to the new server name

if server is reverse proxy you will need also to do the following
The HTTP_HOST variable is set by PHP based on the incoming Host header
connect to the nginx server XXX.XXX.XXX.42
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
nano test-<Site>
	On both 80, and 443
	comment out:	##                   proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
			##                   proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
	proxy_set_header        Host $host;
        proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_redirect          off;
