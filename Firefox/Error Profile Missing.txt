This issue is caused by a problem with the profiles.ini file or with permissions/ownership of involved folders/files.

You can use one of these to make Firefox create a new default profile or recover an existing profile:

delete the profiles.ini file to make Firefox create a new (default) profile
use the Profile Manager to create a new profile
If you still have an existing profile then click "Choose Folder" in the Profile Manager and browse to the location of a lost profile to recover this profile

You should find the profiles.ini file in this hidden location:

Mac: *~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/
Linux: *~/.mozilla/firefox/
Windows: %AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\
*C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\
If clearing the profiles.ini file isn't working then also check the location of the cache files.

Mac: *~/Library/Caches/Firefox/Profiles/
Linux:*~/.cache/mozilla/firefox/
Windows: *C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<profile>\
You can also try to rename/delete the Mozilla\Firefox\ folder in both above mentioned locations (main, cache).
