This plugin allow monitoring of esxi hosts

Installation
	1) Install the "vSphere SDK for Perl" as shown on 
	   "Install VMWare vSphere SDK for Perl to CentOS 7 â€“ CyberGround.pdf"
	2) Install the "check_vmware_esx" plugin as shown on
	   "BaldMansMojo - check_vmware_esx.pdf"
	3) cp /check_vmware_esx-master/modules to /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/
	4) nano -c /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_vmware_esx.pl
		//* Line 1407 replace
			use lib "modules";
		//* with
			use lib "/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/modules";
	5) copy vcenter-auth to nagios4:/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/
	6) on each host to be monitored, create a user, and give it a read-only permissions
		nagios / <Site>nagios123$
	7) Modify the h_host.cfg
		define host{
		#       use                     t_<Site>-vmware
		        use                     t_<Site>_esxi
		        host_name               h_XXX.XXX.XXX.50
		        parents                 h_NetgearS3300-28X-ITRoom
		        address                 XXX.XXX.XXX.50
		        icon_image              vm-host.png
		        statusmap_image         vm-host.gd2
		        }
			

Usage
/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_vmware_esx.pl  --authfile=/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/vcenter-auth --host=XXX.XXX.XXX.50 -S runtime -s health
/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_vmware_esx.pl  --authfile=/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/vcenter-auth --host=XXX.XXX.XXX.50  --select=cpu
/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_vmware_esx.pl  --authfile=/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/vcenter-auth --host=XXX.XXX.XXX.50  --select=mem
/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_vmware_esx.pl  --authfile=/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/vcenter-auth --host=XXX.XXX.XXX.50  --select=net
/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_vmware_esx.pl  --authfile=/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/vcenter-auth --host=XXX.XXX.XXX.50  --select=volumes
/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_vmware_esx.pl  --authfile=/usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/vcenter-auth --host=XXX.XXX.XXX.50  --select=io

Where
	-S, --select=cpu                    CPU usage in percentage
	-w, --warning=<threshold>           Warning threshold in percent.
	-c, --critical=<threshold>          Critical threshold in percent.
	
	-S, --select=mem                    All mem info(except overall and no thresholds)
	-s, --subselect=usage               Average mem usage in percentage
	
	-S, --select=net                    Shows net info
	-s, --subselect=usage               Overall network usage in KBps(Kilobytes per Second).
	
	-S, --select=volumes                Shows all datastore volumes info
	    --gigabyte                      Output in GB instead of MB
	    --alertonly                     List only alerting volumes
	-w, --warning=<threshold>           Warning threshold.
	-c, --critical=<threshold>          Critical threshold.
	                                    Thresholds should be either a simple counter or a percentage
	                                    value in the n% (i.e. 90%). If checking more than a single
	                                    with --usedspace volume only percent is allowed as threshold or
	                                    --spaceleft must be used.
	
	-S, --select=io                     Shows all disk io info. Without subselect no thresholds
	                                    can be given. All I/O values are aggregated from historical
	                                    intervals over the past 24 hours with a 5 minute sample rate
	-s, --subselect=usage               Aggregated disk I/O rate. For hosts, this metric includes
