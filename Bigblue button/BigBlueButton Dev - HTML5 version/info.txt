Safari not supported: (iphone, ipads, desktops, macbooks)
====================
Apple’s Safari browser on both desktop and iOS devices does not yet support WebRTC (though there are indications this
	may change as WebKit, the underlying rendering engine for Safari, is getting support for WebRTC). To support 
	iOS, we are developing an iOS client in a parallel project. The rest of this document focuses on the HTML5 
	client.


HTML5 folder:
============
All the code for the HTML5 client is inside the bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-html5/ folder

The BigBlueButton Flash client can detect if the HTML5 client is installed and available on the server by making a GET request to http://your_ip>/html5client/check and receiving {"html5clientStatus": "running"}.
