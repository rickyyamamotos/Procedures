You should use a search/replace plugin like Better Search and Replace or similar to replace all 
   http://www.yourdomain.com references with https://www.yourdomain.com references.
If you have a massive site, you should probably use the Interconnectit script instead to search/replace
   in your DB and use sed to search/replace in your theme files.
