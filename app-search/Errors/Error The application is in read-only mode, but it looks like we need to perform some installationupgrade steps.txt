From the console
	Error: The application is in read-only mode, but it looks like we need to perform some installation/upgrade steps

From app-search logs
	Swiftype::ES::ReadOnlyModeWriteError


Problem
	app-search is on read-only mode

Causes (or)
	1) somebody set app-seach in read-only mode
	2) the server is running out of storage space (95% usage) and ElasticSearch automatically put all its indexes on read-only
	    to avoid disk full and total crash

Solution for 1
	https://swiftype.com/documentation/app-search/self-managed/read-only-mode
	stop app-search
	$ ./bin/app-search --disable-read-only-mode
	start app-seach

Solution for 2
	https://www.reddit.com/r/elasticsearch/comments/d1odn6/forbidden12index_readonly_allow_delete_<Site>/
	Increase disk space on the server
	See if read_only_mode is enabled on elasticsearch using kibana
		GET _all/_settings 
	Disable read_only_mode:
	1) Option 1 using kibana (WORKS!)
	   Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34911181/how-to-undo-setting-elasticsearch-index-to-readonly
		PUT _settings
		{
		  "index": {
		    "blocks": {
		      "read_only_allow_delete": false
		    }
		  }
		}

	2) Option 2 using kibana (DID NOT WORK)
		PUT /*/_settings { "index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete": null } 
	3) Option 3 using kibana (DID NOT WORK)
		PUT /my_index/_settings
		{
		  "index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete": null
		}
	4) Option 4 using kibana (DID NOT WORK)
		PUT /_settings {   "index": {     "blocks": {       "read_only_allow_delete": "true"     }   } }
