Not implemented because it is risky in a production system (07/25/17)

By default, the current list allows all IP addresses to connect to the Configuration utility. 
If you are adding an IP address or range of IP addresses to the current list the first time, you should perform the 
   following Replacing the current allowed list with a new list procedure
Procedure:
1) Adding an IP address or range of IP addresses to the current allowed list
2) Replacing the current allowed list with a new list
3) Removing an IP address or range of IP addresses from the current allowed list


Adding an IP address or range of IP addresses to the current allowed list:
(This is if you want to keep current allowed host and add new hosts to the list of allowed hosts)
1) Log in to the Traffic Management Shell (tmsh) by typing the following command:
	tmsh
2) To list the IP addresses of the current allowed hosts, type the following command:
	list /sys httpd allow
	//* Take note of the results
3) To add an IP address or range of IP addresses to the current allowed list of hosts, type the following command:
	modify /sys httpd allow add { <IP address or IP address range> }
   For example, to add XXX.XXX.XXX.140 and XXX.XXX.XXX.150 to the current list, you would type the following command:
	modify /sys httpd allow add { XXX.XXX.XXX.140 XXX.XXX.XXX.150 }
   For example, To add the subnet XXX.XXX.XXX.0/<Subnet> to the current list, you would type the following command:
	modify /sys httpd allow add { XXX.XXX.XXX.0/<Subnet> }
4) To list the IP addresses of the current allowed hosts, type the following command:
	list /sys httpd allow
	//* the results should show the new entries
5) Save the change by typing the following command:
	save /sys config


Replacing the current allowed list with a new list:
(This is to remove the previous list of allowed hosts and replace it with new hosts)
Note- Access to the Configuration utility will be denied if the IP address or range of IP addresses is incorrect.
1) Log in to the tmsh utility by typing the following command:
	tmsh
2) To replace the current list of allowed hosts with an IP address or range of IP addresses, type the following command:
	modify /sys httpd allow replace-all-with { <IP address or IP address range> }
   For example, to replace the current list of allowed hosts with XXX.XXX.XXX.140 and XXX.XXX.XXX.150, you would type the following command:
	modify /sys httpd allow replace-all-with { XXX.XXX.XXX.140 XXX.XXX.XXX.150 }
   For example, To replace the current list of allowed hosts with the subnet XXX.XXX.XXX.0/<Subnet>, you would type the following command:
	modify /sys httpd allow replace-all-with { XXX.XXX.XXX.0/<Subnet> }
3) Save the change by typing the following command:
	save /sys config


Removing an IP address or range of IP addresses from the current allowed list:
1) Log in to the  tmsh utility by typing the following command:
	tmsh
2) To remove an IP address or range of IP addresses from the current allowed list of hosts, type the following command:
	modify /sys httpd allow delete { <IP address or IP address range> }
   For example, to remove XXX.XXX.XXX.140 and XXX.XXX.XXX.150 from the current list, you would type the following command:
	modify /sys httpd allow delete { XXX.XXX.XXX.140 XXX.XXX.XXX.150 }
   For example, To remove the subnet XXX.XXX.XXX.0/<Subnet> from the current list, you would type the following command:
	modify /sys httpd allow delete { XXX.XXX.XXX.0/<Subnet> }
3) Save the change by typing the following command:
4) save /sys config

Ports can be further controlled using packet filters. Packet filters allow you to control access based on combinations 
  of criteria that include source IP address, destination IP address, MAC address, and so on.
  See "Configuring Packet Filters" section of the manual
