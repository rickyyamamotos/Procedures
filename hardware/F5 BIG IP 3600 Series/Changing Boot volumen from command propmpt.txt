2) A list of boot image slots and their boot image descriptions displays. 
   Use the arrow keys or type the number of the boot image slot you want to boot at startup, then press Enter. 
3) When you reboot, the system starts from the boot image you specify.


Option2, using the non-iteractive mode
1) $ switchboot -l
	To list the options for the switchboot utility
