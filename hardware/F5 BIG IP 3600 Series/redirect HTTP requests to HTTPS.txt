2 Options, either work: (Option 2 is more efficient)
1) create an iRule to configure a virtual server to automatically redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS
2) configure an HTTP class profile to cause the virtual server to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS

Only option 2 is explained here:
Configuring an HTTP class profile to cause the virtual server to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS
1) Create your virtual server for HTTPS pointing to the pool of servers
2) Create a dummy virtual server for HTTP pointing to no pool, set http class profile to http
3) Creating the HTTP class profile to automatically redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS

	1.2) Click Local Traffic.
	1.3) Click Profiles.
	1.4) From the Protocol box, select HTTP Class.
	1.5) Click Create.

	1.10) Put the exact following content in the Redirect to Location dialog box; this preserves the host and URI information when rewriting the redirect to HTTPS:
		https://[getfield [HTTP::host] ":" 1][HTTP::uri]
	1.11) Click Finished.
4) Associating the HTTP class profile with the virtual server
	2.1) Log in to the Configuration utility.
	2.2) Click Local Traffic.
	2.3) Click Virtual Servers.
	2.4) Click the dummy virtual server with the HTTP class profile.
	2.5) Click Resources.
