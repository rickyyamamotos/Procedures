Site-to-Site VPN to connect the <Location> office and the <Datacenter>

To create VPN to both routers at the office, a nat-over-vpn is needed

Site-to-Site VPN using Main Mode
   A VPN configuration used if both VPN endpoints have static IP addresses

Single Arm: It should be a Single Arm (on way) VPN, where user in the <Location> Office can
   connect to the <Datacenter> using the IP address, but users in the <Datacenter> cant use
   the VPN to connect to the Henrdon Office.



Requirements for a Single Arm VPN
   (https://www.sonicwall.com/support/knowledge-base/vpn-configuring-one-way-vpn-single-arm-mode-in-sonicos-enhanced/170504579116742/)
   - the sonicwall must be in transparent mode
   - This must be configured on the main and secondary Sonicwalls or use a route on the secondary sonicwall to forward them to the main sonicwall
     aka Hub and Spoke VPN
   - Because both office main and office backup share the same ip addresses (they overlap), we need to implement addresses translation on the backup sonicwall

Hub and Spoke VPN
   (https://www.sonicwall.com/support/knowledge-base/implementing-hub-and-spoke-site-to-site-vpn-video-tutorial/170503738192273/)
   <Datacenter> is the HUB
   <Location> office main is 1 spoke
   <Location> office backup is 1 spoke
   Each spoke will need only one VPN policy pointing to the hub. The hub will require two VPN policies, one to each spoke

Address Translation to avoid overlapping or remote IP addresses
   (https://www.sonicwall.com/support/knowledge-base/how-can-i-configure-a-site-to-site-vpn-with-multiple-network-overlaps-nat-over-vpn/170817123531353/)

Transparent Mode
   It enables the SonicWall security appliance to bridge the WAN subnet onto an internal
   interface. It requires valid IP addresses for all computers connected to the interface
   in Transparent Mode on your network, but allows remote access to authenticated users.
   You can use an interface in Transparent mode for public servers and devices with static
   IP addresses you want visible outside your SonicWall security appliance-protected network.
   Note- The sonicwall on the <Datacenter> has its WAN interface already on transparent mode

Steps
   1) Set up a VPN in the standard configuration using Main Mode between office main and the <Datacenter>
   2) Enable theVPN in the standard configuration using Main Mode between office main and the <Datacenter>
   3) Configure the Single-Arm VPN between office main and the <Datacenter>
   4) Set up a VPN in the standard configuration using Main Mode with address tranlation between office backup and the <Datacenter>
   5) Enable the VPN in the standard configuration using Main Mode between office backup and the <Datacenter>
   6) Configure the Single-Arm VPN between office backup and the <Datacenter>

Step 3: Configuring the Single-Arm VPN
   (https://www.sonicwall.com/support/knowledge-base/vpn-configuring-one-way-vpn-single-arm-mode-in-sonicos-enhanced/170504579116742/)
   On the SonicWall whose LAN you want to deny access to over VPN:
   1) Select: Firewall --> Access rules
   2) Under View style, check the matrix radio button
   3) Select the configure icon for VPN to LAN
   4) Click “Add” to add an Access Rule. The Add rule window will appear.

      SonicWall that you have created when establishing the VPN tunnel
      This will not block any existing remote VPN user
   8) Under Destination, select Any
   9) Click OK to save the configuration
Now the network behind the other SonicWall will not be able to access the network
   behind the SonicWall where the deny rule is applied.
