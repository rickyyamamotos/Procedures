in SonicOS 6.2.5.0, all SonicOS default certificates are updated to 2048-bit/SHA-256 encryption, except the Default SonicWall DPI-SSL CA certificate which is updated starting in SonicOS 6.2.5.1.
After upgrading your appliance to 6.2.5 or higher, do one or both of the following to replace the older 1024-bit certificates with the new ones
	1) Navigate to the System > <Site> page, scroll down to Web Management Settings, and click the 		Regenerate certificate button. This regenerates the self-signed HTTPS management certificate.
	2) Navigate to the System > Settings page, click Export Settings to save a copy of your configuration settings, 
		and then click the Boot icon for Current Firmware with Factory Default Settings. This will regenerate 
		all default certificates. After the restart, click the Import Settings button to import your settings 
		and return to your previous configuration.
