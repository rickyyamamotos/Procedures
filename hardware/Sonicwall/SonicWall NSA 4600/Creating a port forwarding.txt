Port Forwarding w/o port translation/redirection
steps:

1) Creating the necessary Address Objects: (Public IP will be forwarded to Server's Private IP)
	-Click Network -> Address Objects -> Add a new Address object -> Server's Public IP
	-Click Network -> Address Objects -> Add a new Address object ->  Server's Private IP
	-For example:
		Name:		SERVER
		Zone Assigment	LAN
		Type		Host
		IP Address	XXX.XXX.XXX.31
2) Creating the necessary Service Object: (Public IP on port designated by a service object will be forwarded to 
	Server's Private IP on a port designated by another service object)
	-Click Network -> Service Objects -> Add a new Service object -> create the necessary Service Objects for 
		the Ports required (we need at least 2 service object, one for the Public and one for the private IP)
	-If you're unsure of which Protocol is in use, perform a Packet Capture.
	-For example:
		Name:		SERVICE1
		Protocol	UDP
		Port range	5060
		Sub Type	None
Firewall Subnets
3) Creating the appropriate NAT Policies which can include Inbound, Outbound, and Loopback
	Once the objects are in place, they can be referenced from the NAT policies.
	A NAT Policy will allow SonicOS to translate incoming Packets destined for a Public IP Address to a 
		Private IP Address, and/or a specific Port to another specific Port.
	Every Packet contains information about the Source and Destination IP Addresses and Ports and with a NAT 
		Policy SonicOS can examine Packets and rewrite those Addresses and Ports for incoming and outgoing traffic.
	NAT policies define the actual port forwarding. For a port forwarding to work properly, there are 3 policies 
		that have to be defined:
		-Inbound policy: directs and translates the service from WAN to the computer behind the firewall.
		-Outbound policy (also called "reflexive" policy): outbound traffic from the computer back to WAN 
			(and the client) gets properly directed (and translated if needed).
		-Loopback policy: allows clients behind the firewall to use the WAN IP to connect to the computer 
			which is also behind the firewall. Sonicwall is one of the few firewalls that actually support this without strenuous configuration.
	Note: When creating a NAT Policy you may select the "Create a reflexive policy" checkbox. This will 
		create an inverse Policy automatically
	-Click Network -> NAT Policies -> Add a new NAT Policy -> create a policy that translate address 
		objects for the specific services objects
	-Example: 
		-Inbound policy (Client access XXX.XXX.XXX.186:5060 and server IP is XXX.XXX.XXX.31)
			Original source		Any (any client with public or private IP)
			Translate Source	Original (keep client's IP address)
			Original Destination	WAN Primary IP (That arrives to the WAN interface of the sonicwall)
			Translated Destination	SERVER (translate public IP(XXX.XXX.XXX.186) to SERVER or private IP(XXX.XXX.XXX.31))
			Original Service	SERVICE1 (Port accessed by client, 5060)
			Translated Service	Original (We are not doing PORT translation, port remains 5060)
						SERVICE2 (Optionally, Use this if we want PORT translation, port to 5061)
			Inbound Interface	Any
			Outbound Interface	Any
			Enable NAT Policy	Checked
		-Outbound policy
			Original source		SERVER (Packet originating from XXX.XXX.XXX.31)
			Translate Source	WAN Primary IP (that arrives to gateway)
			Original Destination	Any (to a Public IP destination)
			Translated Destination	Original (keep the Public IP destination intact)
			Original Service	SERVICE1 (only for destination port 5060)
			Translated Service	Original (do not translate port, keep destination port as 5060)
			Inbound Interface	Any
			Outbound Interface	X1 
			Enable NAT Policy	Checked
		-Loopback policy
			Original source		Firewalled Subnets (only packet comming from LAN)
			Translate Source	WAN Primary IP (translate private IP to is XXX.XXX.XXX.186)
			Original Destination	WAN Primary IP (which destination is XXX.XXX.XXX.186)
			Translated Destination	SERVER (translate XXX.XXX.XXX.186 to XXX.XXX.XXX.31)
			Original Service	SERVICE1 (only for port 5060)
			Translated Service	Original (keep port 5060)
			Inbound Interface	Any
			Outbound Interface	Any
			Enable NAT Policy	Checked
4) Loopback NAT Policy
	A Loopback NAT Policy is required when Users on the Local LAN/WLAN need to access an internal Server via its 
		Public IP/Public DNS Name.
	 Without a Loopback NAT Policy internal Users will be forced to use the Private IP of the Server to access 
		it which will typically create problems with DNS.
	For example If you wish to access this server from other internal zones using the Public IP address 
		Http://1.1.1.1 consider creating a Loopback NAT Policy:
			Original Source: Firewalled Subnets
			Translated Source: X1 IP
			Original Destination: X1 IP
			Translated Destination: Example Name Private
			Original Service: HTTPS
			Translated Service: Original
			Inbound Interface: Any
			Outbound Interface: Any
			Comment: Loopback policy
			Enable NAT Policy: Checked
			Create a reflexive policy: Unchecked
5) Creating the necessary Firewall Access Rules
	With the NAT policies in place, you still have to configure the required firewall rule to allow traffic to 
		pass through the firewall. 
	-Click Firewall -> Access Rules -> Select the View Type as Matrix -> select your WAN to Appropriate Zone 
		Access Rule (This will be the Zone the Private IP of the Server resides on)
	-Click the Add a new entry/Add... button and in the pop-up window create the required Access Rule 
		by configuring the fields as shown below.
			Action:	Allow
			From		WAN
			To		LAN
			Source Port	Any
			Service		Any
			Source		Any
			Destination	Example name public
			Users included	All
			Users excluded	None
			Schedule	Always on
			Enable logging	Checked
			Allow Fragmented packet	Checked
	-For example: Set the destination address object to the WAN IP address, as it will be enough 
		to accept the traffic for the services on the WAN IP of your firewall. Once the traffic 
		is on the firewall, the NAT policies will do the rest.
			Action:	Allow
			From		WAN
			To		LAN
			Source Port	Any
			Service		Any
			Source		Any
			Destination	WAN Primary IP
			Users included	All
			Users excluded	None
			Schedule	Always on
			Enable logging	Checked
			Allow Fragmented packet	Checked
WAN > LAN 	NexVortex_3CX 	3CX Server	Any	Allow 	All

Public Server Wizard:
The Public Server Wizard is a straightforward and simple way to provide public access to an internal Server
through the SonicWall. The Public Server Wizard will simplify the above three steps by prompting your for 
information and creating the necessary Settings automatically.
