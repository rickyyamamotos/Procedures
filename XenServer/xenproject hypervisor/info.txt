Terms:
- Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM): aka hypervisor. 
- Type 1 hypervisor: aka “bare-metal” hypervisor. HYpervisor runs directly on top of the physical machine as opposed to within an operating system.
- domain: Guest virtual machines running on a Xen Project Hypervisor. Composed by dom0 and domUs.
- dom0: domain responsible for controlling the hypervisor and starting other guest operating systems. Privileged domain that can control the hypervisor or start/stop 
  other domains.
- domUs: other guest operating system. Unprivileged domain.
- enlightened guests: custom or modified guest operating systems. These operating systems are aware that they are being virtualized and as such don’t require virtual 
  “hardware” devices, instead they make special calls to the hypervisor that allow them to access CPUs, storage and network resources.
- Hardware virtual machine (HVM):  aka “full virtualization”.  guests need not be modified as the hypervisor will create a fully virtual set of hardware devices for 
  this machine that resemble a physical x86 computer. It requires special CPU extensions - VT-x for Intel processors and AMD-V for AMD based machines.
- Para-virtualisation on HVM (PVHVM): it is a HVM domain with paravirtualized storage, network and other devices. This provides the best of both worlds by reducing 
  expensive emulation but providing hardware accelerated CPU and memory access.

XenProject
it is a Type 1 Hypervisor.

Types of virtualization supported by XenProject:
1) Para-virtualization: Hosts enlightened guests.
2) Hardware virtual machine (HVM):  aka “full virtualization”. 
3) Para-virtualisation on HVM (PVHVM):
