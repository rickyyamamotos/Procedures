TCP timestamps
The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows to compute the uptime.
A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote host can sometimes be computed.


$ nano /etc/sysctl.conf
	net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0
$ echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_timestamps

Optionally set firewall to drop timestamps for icmp
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-request -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-reply -j DROP
