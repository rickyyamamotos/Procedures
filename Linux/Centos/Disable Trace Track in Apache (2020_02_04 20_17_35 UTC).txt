Debugging functions are enabled on the remote HTTP server.
The remote webserver supports the TRACE and/or TRACK methods. TRACE and TRACK are HTTP methods which are used to debug web server connections. 
It has been shown that servers supporting this method are subject to cross-site-scripting attacks, dubbed XST for Cross-Site-Tracing, when used in conjunction with various weaknesses in browsers. 
An attacker may use this flaw to trick your legitimate web users to give him their credentials.

Test
$ telnet <Webserver IP> 80
type the following:
    TRACE / HTTP/1.0
    Host: <hostname_you_are_testing>
    TestA: Hello
    TestB: World
Press enter twice and if trace is enabled, you should see output similar to the following:
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: Apache
    Date: Tue, 04 Aug 2009 20:17:15 GMT
    Content-Type: message/http
    Content-Length: 76
    TRACE / HTTP/1.0
    Host: <hostname_you_are_testing>
    TestA: Hello
    TestB: World

Remediation
$ nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
Append the following
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^(TRACE|TRACK)
    RewriteRule .* - [F]
$ service httpd restart

Re-test as show above
results should be "HTTP 405-Method Not Allowed"
