By processes
	$ cat /proc/meminfo
AnonPages: Non-file backed pages mapped into userspace page tables
Mapped: files which have been mmaped, such as libraries
Slab: in-kernel data structures cache
NFS_Unstable: NFS pages sent to the server, but not yet committed to stable storage
Bounce: Memory used for block device "bounce buffers"
VmallocTotal: total size of vmalloc memory area. 
		The total amount of memory, in kilobytes, of total allocated virtual address space. 
VmallocUsed: amount of vmalloc area which is used
		The total amount of memory, in kilobytes, of used virtual address space. 
VmallocChunk: largest contigious block of vmalloc area which is free
	The largest contiguous block of memory, in kilobytes, of available virtual address space.



Determining real free memory
	//* the system will utlize all unused memory for cache purposes, and free-up the cache when needed
	//* therefore, we need to <Site> the cache utitization
$ free
	look for the -+ buffers/cache used free
	the free number is the potential free memory from cached
