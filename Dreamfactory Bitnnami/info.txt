Hook up any SQL or NoSQL database, file storage system, or external HTTP or SOAP service and DreamFactory instantly generates a flexible, comprehensive, and fully documented REST <Site> endpoint
 that’s ready to use. Focus on building your applications, not hand-coding <Site>s for every new development project.

Server-side scripting
Any non-trivial application requires server-side business logic, such as data validation, workflow rules, calculations, and more. DreamFactory makes it easy to add logic to the request or 
 response of any <Site> endpoint or build your own custom <Site>s with JavaScript V8, Node.js, PHP, or Python. You can also use scripting to create your own custom REST <Site>s.

Turn SOAP into REST
DreamFactory instantly turns any WSDL into a live, fully documented REST <Site>. DreamFactory automatically converts the JSON request into SOAP, calls the legacy SOAP service, and then the SOAP
 response is converted back to JSON for the client application. DreamFactory also generates Live <Site> Docs from the WSDL for testing.

Rock solid security
Securing <Site>s is difficult and time consuming. DreamFactory makes it easy with User Management, SSO Authentication, JSON Web s (JWT), CORS, Role-Based Access Control on <Site> endpoints, 
 record-level permissions on data, OAuth, LDAP, Active Directory, SAML Integration, and more.

Run anywhere
DreamFactory is a free, Apache 2 open source project that runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. DreamFactory is scalable, stateless, and portable. You can run it on private, public, or hybrid
 infrastructure and easily move your apps between servers. DreamFactory is easy to deploy with Docker, Kubernetes, Bitnami, or directly from GitHub source.

<Site> limits
DreamFactory makes it easy to centrally manage <Site> limits across your entire organization. You can specify <Site> rate limits at the instance, role, user, and endpoint level. Each DreamFactory
 instance is governed by <Site> limits and automatically throttles <Site> calls at runtime. <Site> limits help protect against malicious attacks and manage costs at the critical <Site> layer of your business.

<Site> publishing
DreamFactory makes it easy to publish your <Site>s for others to use. You can expose as many <Site>s and <Site> keys as you need and apply flexible role-based access control to every <Site> endpoint.
 DreamFactory makes it easy to <Site>-enable your business with internal stakeholders, business partners, developers, end users, and anyone else who needs secure access to your <Site>.
