iPerf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, buffers and protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP with IPv4 and IPv6). For each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other parameters. This is a new implementation that shares no code with the original iPerf and also is not backwards compatible.
iPerf is designed to do exactly that and it is cross-platform. Download the version for your OS. On one of the computers run iperf -s (this is the server) and on the other run iperf -c <server hostname or IP> (this is the client). Then wait for the results. There are many options to tweak the measuring. Check iperf -hfor a complete list of options.
