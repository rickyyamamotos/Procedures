I can be alerted when anyone of the host has a problem.
1) Go to Manage Monitors
2) Create a new monitor
3) Integration
4) Apache
5) Scope: all hosts
6) Integration Metric
7) get: Apache.performace.cpu.load 
8) alert condition: above, on average, 5 minutes
9) Say what's happening: 
	CPU load is very high {{host.name}}
	{{host.name}} is {{/is_alert}}
10) Save
