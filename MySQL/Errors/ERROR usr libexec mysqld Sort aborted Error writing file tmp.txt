[ERROR] /usr/libexec/mysqld: Sort aborted: Error writing file /tmp

cause
	when traffic is high, and lot of sort happens in mysql of the db server (stor1 ) of <Domain>
	when mysql cant process all isntructions at a time, it save unprocessed ones on a tmp file, which
           will be processed when the server catch up
	The normally error occurs when the tmp file fills the disk, it this happens mysql may delete the 
	   tmp files.

Solutions
	attach a new disk to store1
		mount the disk as partition
		change /etc/my.conf
			from 
				tmpdir = /tmp/
			to
				tmpdir = /partition/
		this will increase the availble space for tmp files, and provide more cache before the db crashes again
	disable bin logs
	disable slow query logs




Troubleshooting
	show which is the tmpdir used
		mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'tmpdir';
			/tmp
	Show if /tmp is a mounted partition or not
		$ df -h
	Check the size of mysql tmp files when the problem occurs
		fuser 3306/tcp
			//* PID1
		lsof PID1
			mysqld  14733 mysql   32u   REG               8,18 9705619456 30147474 /tmp/MYck8vf4 (deleted)
				//* the tmp file may be already deleted, you can see "(delete)" on the results
				    from lsof
		ls /proc//fd
			


To investigate
	For xampp users: on my experience, the problem was caused by a file, named '0' and located in the 
	   'mysql' folder. The size was tooooo huge (mine exploded to about 256 Gb). Its removal fixed the 
	   problem.
	MYSQL MAX_SORT_LENGTH
		ref: https://fromdual.com/beware-of-large-mysql-max-sort-length-parameter
		nano /etc/my.cnf
			[mysqld]
			max_sort_length  = 1K
