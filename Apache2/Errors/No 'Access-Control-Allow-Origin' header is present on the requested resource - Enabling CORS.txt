when server1 iframes content from server2, chrome console may show an error:
	No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource
This happens because server2 is not allowing other servers to embed its contents.



The following worked
====================
$ nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
	//* append the following line (at the end)
	Header unset X-Frame-Options

The following did not work anymore
=================================
Fix
nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
	<Directory /var/www/html>
		    AllowOverride All
nano /var/www/html/.htaccess
	Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://<Site>.<Domain>"



Test
on the server with the problem
$ curl -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" -H "Origin: https://google.com" --head https://localhost -k
	//* should show origin *
$ curl -H "Origin: https://example.com" --verbose https://localhost -k
$ curl -H "Origin: https://example.com" -X OPTIONS --verbose https://localhost -k
