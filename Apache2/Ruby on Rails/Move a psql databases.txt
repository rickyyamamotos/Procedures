Dumping the whole database would mean we’d carry over the schema_migrations table as well. schema_migrations 
   consists of a list of identifiers which match up to an app’s migration files - it’s what Rails uses to 
   track which migrations have been run, which is important for e.g. rake db commands, so we don’t want to 
   modify it.
