<Site> is an object

symbols (:name)
	it is a inmutable data type that does not hold a value.
	It is a placeholder, ommonly used as placeholders in Hashes.
	It is used to represent the name of a value, or name of the key in a list.
	Assigning a symbols a value
		 :cool => :symbol
			//* the rocket or arrow syntax was the only way to have a symbol key point to a symbol value
	Convert a string to a symbol
		 "cool" => :thing
			//* converts the string "cool" to a symbol
Hashes
	They are objects that associate lists of arbitrary objects with each other. It is a list
		I.E.
			animals = Hash.new
			animals[:tall] = "giraffe"
			animals[:minute] = "kitten"
			puts animals.inspect
		I.E.
			animals = {:tall => "giraffe", :minute => "kitten"}
			puts animals[: minute]
		I.E.
			food_hash = {
			  :happy => "ice cream",
			  :pensive => "witchetty grub"
			}
			puts "#{:happy}"
				//* ice cream
:exists is a method


if <Site>.exists?(:host => domain)
	check if a key named "host" exists in the list <Site>
	":host" is a symbol
	":host => domain" use the symbol ":host" as a map-key, for key host that is equal to domain
<Site>.exists?(:host => domain) is translated to:
	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `canvas_<Site>s` WHERE `canvas_<Site>s`.`host` = 'https://<Site>'
replace with
	<Site>.where(:host => domain).any?
