	//* append the following line in the virtualhost section
		//* To allow iframe from pages of the same server

If you do not have access to your httpd.conf or apache.conf file, you can create a .htaccess file in the directory you want to exempt (/example.com/docroot/frameme in this example) and include the following line in the file:
Header always unset X-Frame-Options
In .htaccess
$ nano /var/www/html/.htaccess
	# append the following line To allow iframe from pages of the same server
	Header append X-FRAME-OPTIONS "SAMEORIGIN"
	#OR
	# append the following lines to allow it from other sites
	Header set X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN
	Header append X-Frame-Options "ALLOW-FROM http://www.example.com/"  
	Header append X-Frame-Options "ALLOW-FROM http://example.com/"
	Header append X-Frame-Options "ALLOW-FROM https://www.example.com/"
	Header append X-Frame-Options "ALLOW-FROM https://example.com/"
