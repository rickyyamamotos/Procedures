AbstractControllerDoubleRenderError in ContentController#create_content
Render and/or redirect were called multiple times in this action. Please note that you may only call render OR redirect, and at most once per action. Also note that neither redirect nor render terminate execution of the action, so if you want to exit an action after redirecting, you need to do something like "redirect_to(...) and return".

<Username>, even if my ruby knownledge is very basic, it looks like the error may be generated by an unfinished rubu code.
Error: AbstractController::DoubleRenderError in ContentController#create_content
In <Site>:/app/controllers/content_controller.rb :
def create_content
	get_canvas_<Site>_details
	# make a get request to <Username>s <Site> endpoint with the authetication  and the key
	# if there is a successfull response from the endpoint shoe the form to select the content
	# if the response is not successfull, redirect to the request key and  page url wil be given by <Username>.
	redirect_to manage_content_path(params:params)
end

Note- I dont understant which action is being performed by create_content. I think that it does nothing in the way it currently is.
Maybe the code is not finished? Maybe the create_content's redirect_to is missing the "and return if" part?



It is not a ssl cert isue
