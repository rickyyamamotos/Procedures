Elasticsearch makes differentials repositories only. To make a monthly full snapshot, you will need to create a new repository as full snapsjhots are made on new repositories

The idea of creating a full backup once a month is to create a new repository and make a snapshot on the repository. We better dont delete old repositories if you will need to restore from previous months

Creating a new repository
//* we get the year-month numbers
//* we create a directory: /elasticsearch-backup/year-month
PUT /_snapshot/year-month
   1) using kibana
	{
	  "type": "fs",
	  "settings": {
	    "location": "/elasticsearch-backup/year-month"
	  }
	}
   2) Using curl
	curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/_snapshot/my_backup?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
	{
	  "type": "fs",
	  "settings": {
	    "location": "my_backup_location"
	  }
	}

Deleting a repo
When a repository is un<Site>ed, Elasticsearch only removes the reference to the location where the repository is storing the snapshots. The snapshots themselves are left untouched and in place.
   1) using kibana
	DELETE /_snapshot/my_backup
   2) Using curl
	 curl -X DELETE "localhost:9200/_snapshot/my_backup?pretty"
