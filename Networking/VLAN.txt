VLAN allow the partition of a single physical swith onto 2 or more virtual switches, each not connected to the others.

VLAN tag on switch ports: Tag the eggress packets on the port
	 needed for trunks (that transport more than 1 vlan)
	 for ports that server more than 1 vlan
	 for trunks connected to a vswitch with multiple vlans
	 for ports set different native lan (Port PVID)
VLAN untag on switch ports: 
	 for port connected to computers.

Setting up vlans on a switch
	Create a vlan
	select the port and trunks that are members of the vlan
	Note- different vlans can use the same ports, but these ports must be taged.
	Set a native vlan for the ports (this normally will be the same number of the vlan the port belong to, if not then the port needs to be tagged)

A tagged interface is an interface that is configured to process traffic for multiple VLANs. A VLAN tag identifies the specific VLAN and allows traffic to be passed through that specific VLAN. In order to cause traffic for multiple VLANs to be passed through a single trunk, you must assign the same trunk to each VLAN.
