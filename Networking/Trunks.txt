For Netgear and F5, trunks refers to the link aggregation of multiple links into a trunk link
For Cisco and others, trunks refer to tagging and native vlans

Creating a Trunk in F5
-create a trunk (trunk1) that includes two interfaces, 1.1 and 1.2, -then assign trunk1 as a tagged interface to both VLAN external and VLAN internal.

Since VLAN tag applies tagging to eggress packets, set tagging to any ports that is connecting to another port carring more than 1 vlan.
If a port carry multiple vlans, all vlans need to be tagged for this port except the native vlan which should be untagged.



Create a Trunk between a physical switch and a server with VMWare Host
-Check if the following is needed ???????????????
	-Click the NIC Teaming tab.
	-From the Load Balancing dropdown, choose Route based on 		originating virtual port ID.
-Create a vswitch with two nics
-Create a PortGroup for each vlan with the respective VLAN ID, and connect the Portgroups to the vswitch. 
-Connect the VM to the portgroup that have the same subnet
-On the physical switch 
	-set the ports as tagged (No trunk/LAG is needed and they are not supported by vmware)
	-Set Spanning-tree to portfast trunk (for example, port forwarding, skips other modes)
-Do not assign a VLAN to a port group that is same as the native VLAN ID of the physical switch. Native VLAN packets are not tagged with the VLAN ID on the outgoing traffic toward
