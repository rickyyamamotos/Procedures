pem, key, and crt are just different "extensions" but are all essentially text files.

JUST USE THE PEM FILES
your key file (mysite.com.key) will be privkey.pem
your cert file (mysite.com.crt) will be cert.pem
your ca file ( AlphaSSL.crt in your example) will be chain.pem or fullchain.pem ( depending exactly what you need )

OR COPY THEM AND USE THE CRT AND KEY FILES
copy cert.pem cert.crt
copy privkey.pem privkey.key
