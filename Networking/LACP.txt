Link Aggregation Control Protocol
It is a protocol for switches and NICs

It aggregate one or more Ethernet interfaces to form a logical point-to-point link, known as a LAG, virtual link, or bundle. The MAC client can treat this virtual link like a single link.
The switch can dynamically group similar ports into a single logical link, which will highly extend the bandwidth and flexibly balance the load.

For FM I/O cards, the mgmt IP must be in a different vlan than the production vlan
During the configuration of the LAG on the FN I/O the production vlan or subnet is not determined
It is determined by the servers or vmware host connected

LACP is a trunk that negotiates its members links.
To negotiate, one side of the trunk must be set to passive LACP and the other to active LACP

It is recommended to put the F5 is passive LACP.
F5 trunk only use 1 link, and keep the others in inactive mode until the active link fails.

Set Active mode on one of the ends, or on both. But at least one of the ends has to be in active mode.
