Names:
	-Wildcard SSL Certificate
	-Subject Alternative Names (SANs) secured Wildcard

How it works:
You get a certificate and then add all subdomains in the "Subject Alternative Names (SANs)" extension.
You generate keys for each SAN, then deploy the keys to each respective subdomain.

To renew:
-request the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) from any server holding the certificate
-install the certificate on that server
-export the certificate (private key) and then install it onto all other servers that service the sudomains.


Benefits
-managing multiple sites hosted across numerous subdomains
-you can issue copies of your certificate on as many servers as you want, each of which is assigned its own private key.
-Add, change, or delete a SAN at any point during the lifecycle of the certificate for no extra charge.
-wildcards themselves can have subjectAltName extensions, including other wildcards. 
	For example: The wildcard certificate *.wikipedia.org has *.m.wikimedia.org as a Subject Alternative Name
-one SSL to install and manage if page are hosted in godaddy
-Managing and renewing just one certificate. But deployment of the renewed keys must be done to each server anyways.
-Godaddy offers it. Unlimited subdomain at not extra cost

Disadvantages againts "Multi-Domain SAN Certificate"
-the wildcard only covers one level of subdomains. Then test.dev.example.com will not be covered for *.example.com
-It is not possible to get a wildcard for an "Extended Validation Certificate"
-some Web servers might require a unique IP address for each subdomain on the Wildcard certificate.


Example
*.example.com
www.example.com
mail.example.com
blog.example.com
