Implement Round Robin DNS load-balancing 

Add a second nic to nginx
XXX.XXX.XXX.252	<- XXX.XXX.XXX.183

log into <Site>-nginx (XXX.XXX.XXX.42)
$ shutdown now

log into the VM host (XXX.XXX.XXX.50) -> Select <Site>-nginx -> edit setting -> Add network adapter -> BackupWAN
Start the <Site>-nginx VM

Log into nginx (XXX.XXX.XXX.42)
	setting a gateway for each nic
	(https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Two_Default_Gateways_on_One_System)
$ sudo su
$ cd /etc/network
$ ifconfig
	//* get the name of the 2nd NIC, for example ens192
$ nano /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
	//* append the following line
	/etc/iproute2/rt_tables 
$ nano interfaces
# The backup network interface
	auto ens192
	iface ens192 inet static
	address XXX.XXX.XXX.252
	netmask <Subnet>
	network XXX.XXX.XXX.0
	broadcast XXX.XXX.XXX.255
	# gateway XXX.XXX.XXX.1
	dns-nameserver XXX.XXX.XXX.1
	dns-nameserver XXX.XXX.XXX.1
	dns-nameserver 8.8.8.8
	post-up ip route add XXX.XXX.XXX.0/24 dev ens192 src XXX.XXX.XXX.252 table rt2
		# the network, XXX.XXX.XXX.0/24, can be reached through the ens192 interface
	post-up ip route add default via XXX.XXX.XXX.1 dev ens192 table rt2
		# sets the default gateway
	post-up ip rule add from XXX.XXX.XXX.252/32 table rt2
	post-up ip rule add to XXX.XXX.XXX.252/32 table rt2
		# both traffic from to the IP address, XXX.XXX.XXX.252, as well as traffic directed to or through this IP address, should use the rt2 routing table.
$ reboot
$ ip route show
	//* this will show the gateway
$ ip route list table rt2

log onto the linksys router for the backup internet
This is not the sonicwall, but the linksys because it is the one doing NAT (consider moving out the netgear and providing DHCP from sonicwall)
connect to the backup internet
see if linksys can handle more public ip and redirect to private other than its management IP





RDP onto the Public DNS server <ServerName> (XXX.XXX.XXX.3)
Start -> Administrative tools -> DNS -> Forward Lookup Zones -> <Site> -> wordpress495 -> Add A record
	.	XXX.XXX.XXX.183
	www	XXX.XXX.XXX.183
This will allow clients browsers to do Round Robin

SSL Certificates
It is not an issue, as the server is the same. This design make the sites resilient to the WAN connection
